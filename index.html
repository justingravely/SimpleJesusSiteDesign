          <h1>Father</h1>
          <p>The Father is the leader of the trinity. Everything that is is by his will. He is the mastermind beyond our wildest imaginations. Even in paradise I doubt we will fully comprehend what he is capable of. (Also applies to God as a whole)</p>

          <h1>Son</h1>
          <p>Jesus is the Son of the living God who was sent down from heaven to pay the debt of sin for all humanity by taking up the likeness of sinfull flesh, living a sinless life, and dying a gruesome death on the cross. He now sits at the right hand of God.</p>

          <h1>Spirit</h1>
          <p>The Spirit of God is God's personal presence manifest as a third unique person of the trinity. He is the helper, the comforter, finisher, and more. The holy spirit is what gave Jesus his power to perform the miracles in his ministry.</p>

        <h1>What we're about</h1>
        <p>This is a site to rediscover God. Many have heard of God but do not know very simple yet key or interesting facts about him as spoken in the Bible. This is largely due to God being such a casually common topic therefore it's easy to overlook or discover new things about him.</p>
